##Workflow 
1 Planning system 
    Assign syllabus to Excel spreadsheet
    Estimate hours per syllabus including margin of error (reviews - practice)
2.Pre-learning system (1 layer encoding) [1H]
    Select Index Global 
    Separate them by global themes (Git - GitHub)
    Create an accurate index of the themes (class-until-class number)
3.Atopic learning [2H] 
    Review Videos El  (don't need this step for this course)
    Analysis → creation of high-level learning hypotheses 
        Review Open AI 
        Why is it important? 
        Can I relate them? 
        Can I simplify them? 
        Can I categorize them into fragments? 
        I've finished Big Picture? (I've just create relations on this folder, don't draw organization system)

Learning Workflow (2 layer encoding) [+20H] if Class==conceptual-comprehension, else omit it
    1.Trends Index (not necessary)
        Video 2.0X
        a.Identify where is "conceptual comprehension" 
        b. Apply high order learning encoding (do not
        memorize or understand, relate, compare and
        organize)
        b. Identify the key points
        c. I stop it when I've got "conceptual comprehension"
        Code within the organization system (Big Picture) (layer 1)
    2.Atopic learning (Quick review of multiple sources) if Class==code-comprehension
        Review Forum
        Select Summary
        Understand it
        Use Open AI to reinforce
        Reinforce Big Picture (layer 2)
    3.Comprehension Workflow and practical application
        Divide Big Picture - Workflow by theme
        Video 1.0X"
        Focus on comprehension  "code comprehension"
        Relate and create a 1-layer coding workflow
        Program at the end of class. !important
    4.Design Workflow coding 2 layer + Accumulative project (optional)
        Step-by-step system of a definitive goal    
        Design Workflow .js files and readme
        Create documentation based on this.
    5. Feedback Loop What did u useful?
        Translate through Open AI
        English Open AI
        Relate things to pre-learning progress
        View once video 1.0X
        test code throughout of class
        pratique-end
        Organization system by colors

##Targets to lesson 🧠 
        ##What did I learn?
            Identify when I got passive learning 
            omit until find key-word out getting curiosity 
            Generate hypotheses through key-words list
        ##How to recall information-not-practice
            videos to teach them all 
            post to blog or readme learning 
            audio-sums to recall anywhere 
        ###What did I learn? (learn fastest way)
            You won't scientific,but you'll a resolver person. 
            CS50 Harvard is the most fundamental introduction.
            DEVpost inspirations projects

        ##Pre-learning 
            key-words with AI 
            relate important key-words
            create hypotheses
            design organization system
        ##Learning
            evaluate hypotheses
            add deep accompaniments or information
            practice immediately code 

    


        ##Workflow Project-Async-Start  
            1.Repository 
            2.Copy html (css included from framework)
            3.RapidAPI sign in 
            4. callback Id to pass info though fetch 
            .Api Consumed 
            5. pass to code retrieved for turn out 
            async-await 

        ##Deploy git-pages 
                1. Install npm
                2. settings deploy .json
                3. Push all origin 
                4. npm run deploy 

#WIDE PROJECT 
    ##Idea -> Im gonna make build-channels-videos about Messi  though HTML-CSS-Javascript 
    ##Concepts to apply 
        1. Layout html-css 
        2.Modules javascript 
        3. GET Apis data
        4.Manipulation DOM
        5.Async handling
            ###Workflow ('Draft BIG PICTURE')
                1.Create workspace src-assets-json-npm-gitHub
                2.To pass files-images inside recourses folder 
                3.Create html-css files (don't forget view changes immediately )
                4.Javascript DOM to Channels and main-video-space
                5.Javascript GET videos though async Promises as fetch.
                6. Validation all DOM connected.
